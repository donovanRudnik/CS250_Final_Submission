# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Software development typically involves taking the needs of end users and stakeholders and turning them into working software. The user story is one tool that helps in this process. The purpose of a user story is to identify a person that needs to perform an action in order to achieve something. This is just one method that allows a developer to translate needs into code. By breaking development down into these smaller stories, teams are able to clearly see what needs to be done to achieve their goals. In the SNHU Travel Project, we identified that end users want a list of popular destinations. We were able to break that need down into smaller stories to achieve the goal of a page that displays popular travel destinations.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have been slowly planning a personal project in the little free time I have over the past month. I have been trying to approach it like a one-person Scrum team. Currently, I'm in the process of breaking the project down into smaller stories to get a better idea of what I want to do. Once I have a decent number of stories, I will prioritize them based on what is needed for the program to function. At a high level view, I know that I need a database, a client-side, and a server-side to do what I want. Each of those pieces can be broken down into smaller parts, then ordered based on how important they are to the functionality of the program. As of right now, I plan to build a server API that acts like a base that the other parts will plug into.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

A good team member is the same no matter the team you are on. The ability to work well with other people and communicate your thoughts are invaluable skills within a team. It is still important to have a deep understanding of the fundamentals and the ability to constantly learn new things, but if you cannot communicate with the rest of the team, more often then not you will become a hindrance to them more than anything.
